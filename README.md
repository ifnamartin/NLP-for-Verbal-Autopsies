# NLP-for-Verbal-Autopsies

In this work we will thoroughly explain the idea behind word embedding. We will show how the explicit calculation of these dense vectors
is carried out by designing the neural network from scratch, to later use
it in the calculation of the semantic similarity between texts, as well as to
study and optimize its operation in this task. For the latter, we will test the
embeddings in a specific corpus of a medical type based on verbal autopsies
(VA). On this corpus, experiments will be carried out with the intention of
both testing the usefulness of embeddings and trying to make improvements
to existing studies with respect to VAs that we will present below.
